Here are some notes. about this project.

Maybe prompt the user upon pageload for their name?
Then store that name as a variable, figure out how to insert it into the message array.
not about me, nothing personal, no pity, no passive agressiveness. no explaining about that.
but also not for them, not their interactive thing, they are just observing. kind of interacting though.
make their name lowercase no matter what they type. Only user their name that once. its not that personal.

take everything they type and insert it into the space as a 2D sprite.
Do this even after the convo ends, keep adding to the 2D sprite world.
Maybe take away the chat dialogue at that point? so its only 3D exploring.
maybe store every message they write in an array, than later have the bot mock
them with their own words.lol
separate from the typing-icon cubes.
Connect them with lines? Study the linebufferCall example in three.js
study CalculateBoundingSphere() call
have them all slowly move? or static?
camera motion responds to mouse position.
use OrbitControls.js  ??

!! check out if http://wh.at is available as a domain for me to buy.

Start with black background and welcome-panel that is prompting user for their name

good idea: each time the bot replies, it adds message-icon boxes
each time you reply, you add lines that connect them!
the camera slowly rotates.

after you gain your voice, your messages become inserted as blue shiny spheres?
- how do u incorporate text to this?
